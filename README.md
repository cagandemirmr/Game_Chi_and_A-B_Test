# üéÆ Game Analysis with A/B Testing and Chi-Square Test

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing game-related user data to evaluate the effectiveness of different onboarding variants using **A/B testing** and the **Chi-Square test**. The goal is to determine whether variant changes influence user engagement and purchases. For this analysis, I utilized **SQL** to gather insights and perform statistical tests.

## üìÇ Data Import and Setup
- Imported CSV files into SQL tables using the `CREATE TABLE` statement and loaded data using the file paths.
- The dataset consists of artificially generated data using ChatGPT, simulating user behaviors and actions in a game environment.

## üß™ A/B Testing & Chi-Square Analysis

### 1. Initial Chi-Square Test
- Conducted a **Chi-Square test** online to compare the success rates between **Variant 1** and the **Control Group**.
- **Result**: Variant 1 was significantly more successful.

### 2. Calculating Statistical Metrics
- Used SQL functions (`AVG`, `STDDEV`) to compute **mean** and **standard deviation** for further statistical analysis.

### 3. Updated Chi-Square Test
- Recalculated the Chi-Square test with SQL-derived metrics.
- **Result**: No significant difference between **Variant 1** and **Control** after recalculating.

## üéØ Hypothesis Testing

### 1. Onboarding Completion Analysis
- Joined the `game_actions` table to assess the total number of users who completed onboarding.
- **Result**: The null hypothesis was rejected, indicating a significant difference between the two variants.

### 2. Success Metric: Purchase Behavior
- Redefined the success metric as **user purchases** and reran the analysis.
- **Result**: Significant difference between the two variants based on purchase behavior.

### 3. 7-Day Interval Analysis
- Performed an analysis to evaluate differences over a 7-day interval.
- **Result**: No significant difference between the variants in a week-by-week comparison.

### 4. Time Period Analysis
- Analyzed differences between two distinct time periods.
- **Result**: Significant differences observed, but reliability may be affected by external factors.

### 5. Country-Based Analysis (Canada vs. USA)
- Compared user behavior between Canada and the USA.
- **Result**: Differences were noted, but conclusions may be unreliable due to varying population sizes and demographic factors.

## üìä Insights and Conclusions
1. **Variant 1** initially appeared to be more effective than the Control group based on onboarding actions.
2. However, when shifting the metric to actual **purchases**, the difference between the variants became less clear.
3. The time-based analysis revealed fluctuations that could be due to external factors, making it necessary to control for variables like seasonality or promotional events.
4. Country-specific analyses suggest that demographic factors may influence game engagement and purchases.
