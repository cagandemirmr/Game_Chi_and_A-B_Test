# Game_Analysis
In this repo, i use hypotetical mobile game company data set is used to make chi square test and A/B testing

I calculated chi square with these results on a website to see which one is more succesful.According to this result, variant 1 is much more succesful compared to control group.

We find results but we need to find basic parameters like mean and standart deviation to calculate chi square for my own.

So i calculate this measures with avg and stddev functions.

When i calcualted these results online, i can see that there is no significant difference between variant1 and control.

To calculate total number of gamer on boarding i join game_actions table. Accoring to results i do not accept null hypotesis that means there is a difference between two categories.

But as a succes metric, i define purchase thus i recreated calculation.According to test, it shows that there is difference between two categories.

In terms of 7 day interval, There is no difference between them.

If i make test on two different period whether there is a significant difference between two periods.
I can see that there is a significant difference between these results.

But it can not be reliable because of planned and unexpected events.

If I tried to compare two different countries like Canada and USA.
I can get this results.

Whether there is a significant difference  it can be tricky because these countries do not have same amount of population, etc.
