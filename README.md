I calculated chi square with these results on a website to see which one is more succesful.According to this result, variant 1 is much more succesful compared to control group.

We find results but we need to find basic parameters like mean and standart deviation to calculate chi square for my own.

So i calculate this measures with avg and stddev functions.

When i calcualted these results online, i can see that there is no significant difference between variant1 and control.

To calculate total number of gamer on boarding i join game_actions table.
